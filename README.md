The project presents a web based art therapy platform inspired by the work of Japanese artist, Yayoi Kusama, specifically, her use of repeating, colorful dots to cope with mental illness and to represent obliteration and infinity.


The platform gives the user space to freely draw out their feelings uses a variety of pen stroke styles and then gives them a chance to purge those feelings through an “obliteration” mode that covers the canvas with colorful dots drawn from one of Kusama’s famous works, the Obliteration Room.


This project was exhibited in the NYU Shanghai Interactive Media Arts Showcase in Fall 2018.
